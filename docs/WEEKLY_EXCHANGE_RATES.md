# Weekly Exchange Rates Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds weekly exchange rate management functionality to the GBR application, allowing users to set exchange rates for entire weeks instead of daily rates.

## Changes Made

### Database Schema Changes

- Added `WeeklyPrice` model to `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added `WeeklyPriceType` enum with COMMODITY and EXCHANGE values
- Added relationships to `Exchange` and `Commodity` models
- Added unique constraints to prevent duplicate rates for the same week

### API Routes

- Created `/api/weekly-prices` route for CRUD operations on weekly prices
- Created `/api/weekly-prices/[id]` route for individual price operations
- Implemented week boundary calculations and validation

### Frontend Components

- Created `/setup/weekly-exchange` page for managing weekly exchange rates
- Added week selection with automatic Monday calculation

### Rate Management

- Create weekly exchange rates with validation

- View rate details in modal
- Filter by exchange and week
- Pagination for large datasets

### Data Validation

- Prevents duplicate rates for the same week and exchange
- Validates required fields (exchange, rate, week)

## Database Structure

### WeeklyPrice Model

```prisma
model WeeklyPrice {
  id            String          @id @default(uuid())
  type          WeeklyPriceType
  commodityId   String?         // Only for type COMMODITY
  commodity     Commodity?      @relation(fields: [commodityId], references: [id])
  exchangeId    String?         // Only for type EXCHANGE
  exchange      Exchange?       @relation(fields: [exchangeId], references: [id])
  price         Float
  weekStartDate DateTime        // Start of the week (Monday)
  weekEndDate   DateTime        // End of the week (Sunday)
  createdAt     DateTime        @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime        @updatedAt

  @@unique([type, commodityId, weekStartDate], name: "unique_weekly_commodity_price")
  @@unique([type, exchangeId, weekStartDate], name: "unique_weekly_exchange_rate")
}
```

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/weekly-prices

- Query parameters: `type`, `itemId`, `week`
- Returns: Array of weekly prices with exchange/commodity data

### POST /api/weekly-prices

- Body: `{ type, itemId, price, weekStartDate? }`
- Creates new weekly price entry
- Validates uniqueness for the week

### GET /api/weekly-prices/[id]

## Migration Notes

- Future migration from daily to weekly rates can be implemented if needed
