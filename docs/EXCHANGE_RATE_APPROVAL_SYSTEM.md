# Exchange Rate Approval System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive exchange rate approval system with SMS and email notifications for the GBR application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### WeeklyPrice Model Enhancements

- Added `status` field with enum: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`
- Added `submittedBy` and `approvedBy` user references
- Added `approvedAt` timestamp
- Added `rejectionReason` for rejected rates
- Added `notificationSent` flag

#### User Model Enhancements

- Added `phone` field for SMS notifications
- Added `emailNotifications` and `smsNotifications` preferences
- Added relations for submitted and approved rates

### 2. Notification System

#### NotificationService Class

- **Email Notifications**: Configurable email service integration
- **SMS Notifications**: Configurable SMS service integration
- **Super Admin Targeting**: Automatically notifies all super admin users
- **Fallback Logging**: Logs notifications when services are not configured

#### Notification Types

- **Approval Required**: Sent when new rate is submitted
- **Rate Approved**: Confirmation when rate is approved
- **Rate Rejected**: Notification with rejection reason

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Enhanced Weekly Prices API

- `GET /api/weekly-prices?approvedOnly=true` - Fetch only approved rates
- `POST /api/weekly-prices` - Creates rates with PENDING status
- `GET /api/weekly-prices/[id]/approve` - Approve/reject rates
- `GET /api/weekly-prices/pending` - Get pending approvals (Super Admin only)

### 4. Frontend Updates

#### Weekly Exchange Management Page

- **Status Column**: Shows PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED status
- **Approval Actions**: Approve/Reject buttons for pending rates
- **Modal Confirmations**: Detailed approval/rejection dialogs
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh after actions

#### Pending Approvals Page

- **Super Admin Dashboard**: Dedicated page for managing approvals
- **Bulk Actions**: Quick approve/reject functionality
- **Detailed Information**: Shows submitter, rate details, timestamps
- **Status Indicators**: Visual status with icons and colors

#### Assay Creation Updates

- **Approved Rates Only**: Frontend fetches only approved exchange rates
- **Validation**: Ensures assays use verified rates

### 5. Security & Access Control

#### Role-Based Permissions

- **Super Admin Only**: Can view and process pending approvals
- **Regular Users**: Can only see/use approved rates
- **Audit Trail**: All approval actions are logged

#### Data Integrity

- **Immutable Approvals**: Once approved, rates cannot be modified
- **Status Validation**: Prevents actions on already processed rates
- **User Authentication**: All actions require valid user context

## Workflow Process

### 1. Rate Submission

```
Finance User → Submits Rate → Status: PENDING → Notifications Sent
```

### 2. Approval Process

```
Super Admin → Reviews Rate → Approves/Rejects → Status Updated → Notifications Sent
```

### 3. Rate Usage

```
Approved Rate → Available for Assays → Invoice Generation → Financial Calculations
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Email Service (Optional)
EMAIL_SERVICE_URL="https://api.emailservice.com/send"
EMAIL_API_KEY="your-email-api-key"

# SMS Service (Optional)
SMS_SERVICE_URL="https://api.smsservice.com/send"
SMS_API_KEY="your-sms-api-key"

# Fallback: Notifications logged to console if services not configured
```

### User Preferences

- **Email Notifications**: Enabled by default
- **SMS Notifications**: Disabled by default (requires phone number)
- **Phone Numbers**: Optional field for SMS delivery

## Integration Points

### Assay Creation

- Only approved exchange rates are available for selection
- Prevents use of unverified rates in financial calculations

### Invoice Generation

- Validates that assays use approved exchange rates
- Blocks invoice creation if rate is not approved

### Audit Trail

- All approval actions are logged with user information
- Rejection reasons are recorded for accountability

## Benefits

### Financial Control

- ✅ Prevents unauthorized rate changes
- ✅ Ensures all calculations use verified rates
- ✅ Maintains audit trail for regulatory compliance

### Operational Efficiency

- ✅ Automated notifications reduce manual follow-up
- ✅ Clear approval workflow prevents bottlenecks
- ✅ Real-time status updates keep everyone informed

### Risk Management

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Submit exchange rate as regular user
- [ ] Verify PENDING status and notifications
- [ ] Approve rate as super admin
- [ ] Verify APPROVED status and notifications
- [ ] Reject rate with reason
- [ ] Verify REJECTED status and notifications
- [ ] Test assay creation with approved rates only
- [ ] Test invoice generation validation

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features

- Bulk approval operations
- Rate change impact analysis
- Automated approval rules
- Integration with external financial APIs
- Advanced notification templates

### Monitoring & Analytics

- Approval metrics dashboard
- Rate change history reports
- User activity analytics
- Performance monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Notifications not sending**: Check service configuration and API keys
2. **Permission denied**: Verify user roles and authentication
3. **Rate not appearing**: Check approval status and filters
4. **Database errors**: Verify schema migrations and foreign key constraints

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check pending rates
curl -H "x-user-role: SUPERADMIN" /api/weekly-prices/pending

# Test notification service
curl -X POST /api/test-notifications

# Check user permissions
curl -H "x-user-id: user-id" /api/user/permissions
```

## Conclusion

The exchange rate approval system provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly workflow for managing financial data approvals. The implementation ensures:

- **Data Integrity**: Only approved rates are used in calculations
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete trail of all approval actions
- **User Experience**: Clear workflow with automated notifications
